To find the min and max in one pass, we will first assume first element is min and max. We will compare each element with min, and max.
If we find min less then initial min we will replace or if we find a max more than max then that will be new max.

We will be going thought the array once. Hence time complexity is O(n) and we do not need any extra storage for the array hence space complexity is O(1).
This is a linear search.
