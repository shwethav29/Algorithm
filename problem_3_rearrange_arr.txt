To form two numbers such that their sum is maximum from a given array of numbers first we need to sort array.

For this I am using mergesort to sort the array in descending order. Mergesort time complexity is O(n logn) in average and in worst case.
The space complexity of this algorithm will be O(n).

After sorting array, I am iterating through the array to form two numbers whose sum is maximum.
number1 is formed by combining elements at even index.
number2 is formed by combining elements at odd index.
The time complexity of forming these two numbers will be O(n)

Hence tha total time complexity of this program will be O(n) + O(n log n)

Space complexity will be O(n).
