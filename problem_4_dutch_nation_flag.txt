As per the problem there are only three possible values in the array 0,1 and 2. So our reorganized array as per Dutch flag will have three partition.
The elements less that one will be in the bottom, elements equal to 1 in the middle and the elements greater than 1 will be in the upper part.
We know the starting index of the bottom part will be 0 and ending index of the upper part will be (length of array)-1.
So we need to find the index of the middle part. Hence to start with we will assume middle index is 0

Now we traverse the list once while middle_index is less than or equal 2 zero. swapping elements that are smaller to 1 towards left and larger to 1 towards right.

Since we traverse the list exactly for 1 time our time complexity is O(n) and since we are doing in place swapping elements of array, space complexity is O(1).
